/**
 * Sales Intelligence MCP Server
 *
 * A unified MCP server for sales teams that integrates:
 * - Gong: Call recordings, transcripts, analytics, and coaching data
 * - ZoomInfo: Company firmographics, contact data, org charts, tech stacks
 * - Clay: Person and company enrichment via data waterfalls
 * - LinkedIn Sales Navigator: Lead search, profiles, and company research
 *
 * Each service registers its tools independently — you only need API keys
 * for the services you want to use. Tools gracefully error with setup
 * instructions when credentials are missing.
 *
 * Transport: stdio (for local Claude Desktop / Claude Code integration)
